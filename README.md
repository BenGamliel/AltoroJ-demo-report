# AltoroJ-demo-report
a demo report for the vulnerable web application AltoroJ
https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/AltoroJ
its the first time i made a PT report on a full scale web application that contains 100+ vulnerabilities 

i used a few automated tools provided by the kali platform such as Nmap nikto nodejsscan(open-source node.js SAST tool) and some free web scanners
but most of the work was done manually with the aid of burp suite community edition 

there were many vulernabilities i wanted to drill down on 
but unfurtunaly due to other obligations i didn't have enough time to do it 
so i hope this basic report will help other junior penetration testers as a reference or a guideline

if you found any mistakes or errors please let me know.
also for any other comment you can reach me at idov3r@gmail.com
